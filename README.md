Hello there! Iâ€™m Efe Ã–ztaban, currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s in Physics at SabancÄ± University. I completed my Bachelorâ€™s in Electronics Engineering with a double major in Computer Science and a minor in Physics. This interdisciplinary education has allowed me to explore the fascinating intersections of engineering, computer science, and astrophysics.

Iâ€™ve had the privilege to work on some exciting projects. During my internship at DTU Space in Denmark, I contributed to the bootloader design for the ATHENA missionâ€™s Wide Field Imager, diving deep into instrumentation and space technologies. Back at SabancÄ± Universityâ€™s HEALAB, I worked on developing an improved X-ray detector for the Sharjah-Sat-1 CubeSat mission, which is launched in 2022. Currently, Iâ€™m studying dust scattering halos and the 3D morphology of interstellar molecular clouds using machine learning. I had the opportunity to present my research at the International Conference on Machine Learning for Astrophysics in Italy in July 2024.

In this era of rapidly expanding astrophysical data, Iâ€™m passionate about applying machine learning to astrophysical research. In my free time, I enjoy radio broadcasting, cooking, traveling, and exploring cinema. Iâ€™m excited to continue my journey in observational astrophysics and artificial intelligence, combining my technical skills with my curiosity about the universe.
